i've been working on wordle-like daily games recently. most recently, i've done https://millie.zone/blue-archival, a blue archive-oriented guessing game!
### my interests

- earthquakes. i like to study the data from sensors in Japan.
- music. i like the funny noises that my computer makes!
- i love the 3DS. my favorite console, and being able to write something and see it come to life on the 3DS is so cool.
